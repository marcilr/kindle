  200GB is the largest capacity that the Fire Tablet is meant to use,
  and you may just want to purchase a microSD of that size to put in
  and forget that it is there.  Sure, 200GB is a lot of space to have,
  but do you want to have to worry about storage ever again?  A few years
  ago it would have cost a fortune to put that much storage inside your
  tablet, but now it is totally affordable.

  You can usually find a pretty good deal on this card, making it run
  anywhere from $65 to $80, which is a great price for how much it can
  hold.  If you don't want to worry about what you have on the tablet
  or deleting one thing to install another, you'll want to get one of
  these right now!
