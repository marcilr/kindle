Best Memory Cards for Amazon Fire Tablet
BY JARED DIPANE Friday, Sep 22, 2017 at 2:00 pm EDT
SanDisk 200GB microSD
200GB is the largest capacity that the Fire Tablet is meant to use,
and you may just want to purchase a microSD of that size to put in
and forget that it is there.  Sure, 200GB is a lot of space to have,
but do you want to have to worry about storage ever again?  A few years
ago it would have cost a fortune to put that much storage inside your
tablet, but now it is totally affordable.

You can usually find a pretty good deal on this card, making it run
anywhere from $65 to $80, which is a great price for how much it can
hold.  If you don't want to worry about what you have on the tablet
or deleting one thing to install another, you'll want to get one of
these right now!
